    <h1>Hello World I am Andrew Stribling and it is nice to meet you!</h1>
    <p>
      I started learning to program back in 2022 when I was looking for another
      department to serve State Farm in. My friend showed me Codecademy and I
      always thought I was good with computers. After a few courses I decided to
      enroll in Nucamps coding bootcamp. Since than I have been practicing in
      python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django, and C#! Programming is wonderful
      because you can build amazing things, work in teams, and being a nerd I
      delight in working with fellow nerds!
